# insertion sort

We have an unsorted list, we should sort it using insertion sort.

## Challenge Description

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

## Approach & Efficiency

Time complexity : o(n**2)
space complexity : o(1)

Algorithm:
1 - Iterate from the second element of the list to the last one over the list.
2- Compare the current element to the prior element.
3 - If the current element is smaller than the prior one, compare it to the elements before.
4 - Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.
